## Installation

To use DigLabTools you need to have a Python installation available on your computer including the `pip` package.
You can install DigLabTools from PyPI via `pip install DigLabTools`.
Note that DigLabTools requires git. If git is not available on your system you can install it manually. When using conda this can be done via `conda install -c anaconda git` .
