## Usage

### Downloading metadata

To download the metadata of a project you can use the command line tool `RedCapBridge` or `ElabBridge`, depending on your choice of metadata server. Use the `RedCapBridge --help` (or `ElabBridge --help`) to learn more about the different functions that the server interface offers.

### Building projects

The functions for project building, validation and control are only accessible via Python. Read the module documentation to learn more about these methods.
